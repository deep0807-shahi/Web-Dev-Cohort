Compiled Language: Code is translated into machine code before running.
                   Needs a compiler.
                   Faster at runtime, but compilation takes time.
                   Example: C, C++

Interpreted Language: Code is executed line by line at runtime.
                      Needs an interpreter.
                      Slower at runtime, but easier to test and debug.
                      Example: Python, JavaScript
                      
JS is an interpreted language 
JS is a dynamically typed language ( dynamically typed language, variable types are determined at runtime.)
JS is a single threaded language (Executes only one task at a time.)

NODE.JS - It's a runtime environment for javascript , alternatives are BUN & DENO 

VARIABLES - In programming, a variable is a named storage location that holds a value. 
            This value can be changed during the program's execution.
            Variables are essential for storing and manipulating data within a program.
